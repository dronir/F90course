# Numerical methods and F90

This is my set of exercise solutions for the numerical methods course.

In the individual exercise directories, run `make partX` to compile part X of the exercise. Running `make` compiles each part of that exercise. `make clean` removes all compiled binaries.

Run `make` in this root directory to compile all exercises (this simply runs the makefiles in the exercise directories), `make clean` to remove all compiled binaries.
